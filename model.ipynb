How may I help you today?\n","\n","Customer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I have a huge problem with my upcoming flight. Ugh, this is so frustrating!\n","\n","Agent: I understand your frustration sir. Can you please provide your confirmation number so I can take a look at your reservation?\n","\n","Customer: *provides confirmation number* It's flight 3849 from Chicago to Los Angeles next Thursday. So basically, I booked this flight months ago for a really important work meeting. But now your stupid website is saying the flight is overbooked! What the hell am I supposed to do now?!\n","\n","Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience, overbooked flights are never ideal. Let me take a look here...umm, it looks like you are correct, this flight is currently oversold. Not the news I'm sure you wanted to hear. Let me see what options I can provide to help get you to your meeting. *typing sounds* It looks like I can offer you a seat on a later departure that same day, at 5:30pm instead of the original 11am time. I'll waive the change fee since this is due to the oversale. Or I can try to get you on another airline, but it would mean going through a different airport than planned. Does either of those work for your schedule?\n","\n","Customer: Are you kidding me? Neither of those work - the meeting is at 10am so both those flights would have me missing it completely. This is unacceptable! Why wasn't I contacted about this sooner? Now what am I supposed to do, my whole trip is screwed!\n","\n","Agent: You're right, missing your meeting is not ideal. Let me check a few other options for you. *more typing* Unfortunately all the flights for that day are oversold as well. I can try putting you on standby for the original flight in hopes that someone doesn't show, but there's no guarantee. As for not contacting you sooner, oversales sometimes happen last minute as passengers cancel or change plans. I apologize for the lack of notice. The best I can offer is a full refund for your ticket since we can't get you there as booked. I'll also provide a $200 travel voucher for the inconvenience.\n","\n","Customer: A refund and $200 voucher isn't going to get me to my meeting! I need to be on that flight or one that same day. This is going to cost me my job if I miss this, ugh I can't believe this. \n","\n","Agent: I completely understand your frustration, missing a critical business meeting because of an airline issue is unacceptable. Umm, let me check one other long shot option...it looks like I may be able to book you on a same-day red-eye on another carrier, flying out of a different airport about an hour away. It would involve renting a car and driving like crazy to make the flight, but you would land in LA around 6am, giving you time to make your 10am meeting. I know it's not ideal, but would that work in a pinch? I can get you booked on that alternate flight right now if you want to go that route.\n","\n","Customer: *long sigh* I guess that's my only choice at this point. Yeah, go ahead and book me, I'll figure out the ride and driving. This is ridiculous. Your airline better compensate me for this huge hassle.\n","\n","Agent: I completely agree, you should not have to deal with all this trouble. Let me get you booked on that flight right now. I'm also going to credit $500 to your account for future travel due to the major inconvenience. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do as you work to make that alternate flight. And again, I sincerely apologize for the trouble. Getting customers where they need to be is the most important thing.\n","\n","Customer: *sighs* Fine, I guess $500 is better than nothing. Thanks for at least getting me on another flight I suppose. This better not happen again!\n","\n","Agent: You have my word we'll do everything we can to avoid an situation like this in the future. Thank you for your patience and for being understanding - I know multiple flight changes is never ideal. Please feel free to reach back out if any other issues come up. Safe travels and I hope your meeting goes well despite the changes!\n","\n","Customer: Yeah, thanks. *hangs up phone angrily*\n","\n","Agent: Thank you for your call. *hangs up*\n"]}],"source":["print(subset_df['call_transcript'].iloc[0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-10T09:24:44.723986Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-10T09:24:44.723531Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-10T09:25:07.065664Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-10T09:25:07.064705Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-10T09:24:44.723934Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Get the actual and predicted call reasons for the subset\n","actual_reasons = subset_df['primary_call_reason'].tolist()\n","predicted_reasons = [predict_call_reason(call_id) for call_id in subset_df['call_id'].tolist()]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":42,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-10T09:27:05.793537Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-10T09:27:05.793052Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-10T09:27:05.800253Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-10T09:27:05.799313Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-10T09:27:05.793480Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["['Seating',\n"," 'Voluntary Change',\n"," 'IRROPS',\n"," 'Seating',\n"," 'IRROPS',\n"," 'Post-Flight',\n"," 'Seating',\n"," 'Voluntary Change',\n"," 'IRROPS',\n"," 'Upgrade']"]},"execution_count":42,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["actual_reasons"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Identify unique classes in actual and predicted reasons\n","unique_classes = list(set(actual_reasons + predicted_reasons))\n","\n","# Calculate the classification report\n","report = classification_report(actual_reasons, predicted_reasons, labels=unique_classes, target_names=call_reasons, zero_division=0)\n","print(report)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":64,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-09T21:51:37.672966Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-09T21:51:37.672066Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-09T21:51:57.702474Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-09T21:51:57.701168Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-09T21:51:37.672915Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Predicting:   0%|          | 0/5157 [00:00<?, ?it/s]"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["CATEGORY: Booking Booking\n","CATEGORY: Products & services Products & services\n","CATEGORY: Other topics Other topics\n","CATEGORY: Booking Booking\n","CATEGORY: Booking Booking\n","CATEGORY: Products & services Products & services\n","CATEGORY: Booking Booking\n","CATEGORY: Products & services Products & services\n","CATEGORY: Products & services Products & services\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Predicting:   0%|          | 10/5157 [00:15<2:09:10,  1.51s/it]"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["CATEGORY: Products & services Products & services\n","Uploaded 80 predictions to Hugging Face dataset: korigamik/call_predictions/call_predictions_80\n","File RRcall_predictions_80.csv uploaded to huggingface\n","CATEGORY: Products & services Products & services\n","CATEGORY: Products & services Products & services\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Predicting:   0%|          | 10/5157 [00:19<2:50:55,  1.99s/it]\n","\n","KeyboardInterrupt\n","\n"]}],"source":["start_time = time.time()\n","\n","with tqdm(total=len(call_ids), desc=\"Predicting\") as pbar:\n","    for i in range(0, len(call_ids), batch_size):\n","        batch = call_ids[i:i+batch_size]\n","        batch_predictions = predict_batch(batch, batch_size)\n","        new_predictions = [{'call_id': cid, 'primary_call_reason': reason} \n","                           for cid, reason in zip(batch, batch_predictions)]\n","        predictions.extend(new_predictions)\n","        pbar.update(len(batch))\n","\n","        upload_to_hf(predictions, f\"{DATASET_NAME}_{len(predictions)}\")\n","\n","# Final upload to Hugging Face\n","upload_to_hf(predictions, DATASET_NAME)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-09T20:52:30.204444Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-09T20:52:30.204763Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-09T20:52:30.204616Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-09T20:52:30.204600Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["end_time = time.time()\n","logging.info(f\"Predictions completed in {end_time -
